;; 2.4.3 Lists and Racket Syntax

#| Now that you know the truth about pairs and lists, and 
now that you’ve seen quote, you’re ready to understand the 
main way in which we have been simplifying Racket’s 
true syntax. |#

#| The syntax of Racket is not defined directly in terms 
of character streams. Instead, the syntax is determined 
by two layers: |#

#| a reader layer, which turns a sequence of characters 
into lists, symbols, and other constants; and |#

#| an expander layer, which processes the lists, symbols, 
and other constants to parse them as an expression. |#

#| The rules for printing and reading go together. For 
example, a list is printed with parentheses, and reading 
a pair of parentheses produces a list. Similarly, a 
non-list pair is printed with the dot notation, and 
a dot on input effectively runs the dot-notation rules 
in reverse to obtain a pair. |#

#| One consequence of the read layer for expressions is 
that you can use the dot notation in expressions that 
are not quoted forms: |#

(+ 1 . (2))
;; 3

#| This works because (+ 1 . (2)) is just another way 
of writing (+ 1 2). It is practically never a good idea 
to write application expressions using this dot notation; 
it’s just a consequence of the way Racket’s syntax is 
defined. |#

#| Normally, . is allowed by the reader only with a 
parenthesized sequence, and only before the last element 
of the sequence. However, a pair of .s can also appear 
around a single element in a parenthesized sequence, 
as long as the element is not first or last. Such a pair 
triggers a reader conversion that moves the element 
between .s to the front of the list. The conversion 
enables a kind of general infix notation: |#

(1 . < . 2)
;; #t

'(1 . < . 2)
;; '(< 1 2)

#| This two-dot convention is non-traditional, and 
it has essentially nothing to do with the dot notation 
for non-list pairs. Racket programmers use the infix 
convention sparingly—mostly for asymmetric binary 
operators such as < and is-a?. |#
