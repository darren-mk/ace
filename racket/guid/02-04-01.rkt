;; 2.4.1 Quoting Pairs and Symbols with quote

#| A list prints with a quote mark before it, but
if an element of a list is itself a list, then no 
quote mark is printed for the inner list: |#

(list (list 1) (list 2 3) (list 4))
;; '((1) (2 3) (4))

#| For nested lists, especially, the quote form lets 
you write a list as an expression in essentially the 
same way that the list prints: |#

(quote ("red" "green" "blue"))
;; '("red" "green" "blue")

(quote ((1) (2 3) (4)))
;; '((1) (2 3) (4))

(quote ())
;; '()

#| The quote form works with the dot notation, too, 
whether the quoted form is normalized by the 
dot-parenthesis elimination rule or not: |#

(quote (1 . 2))
;; '(1 . 2)

(quote (0 . (1 . 2)))
;; '(0 1 . 2)

#| Naturally, lists of any kind can be nested: |#

(list (list 1 2 3) 5 (list "a" "b" "c"))
;; '((1 2 3) 5 ("a" "b" "c"))

(quote ((1 2 3) 5 ("a" "b" "c")))
;; '((1 2 3) 5 ("a" "b" "c"))

#| If you wrap an identifier with quote, then you 
get output that looks like an identifier, but 
with a ' prefix: |#

(quote jane-doe)
;; 'jane-doe

#| A value that prints like a quoted identifier is 
a symbol. In the same way that parenthesized output 
should not be confused with expressions, a printed 
symbol should not be confused with an identifier. 
In particular, the symbol (quote map) has nothing 
to do with the map identifier or the predefined 
function that is bound to map, except that the 
symbol and the identifier happen to be made up of 
the same letters. |#

#| Indeed, the intrinsic value of a symbol is nothing 
more than its character content. In this sense, 
symbols and strings are almost the same thing, and 
the main difference is how they print. The functions 
symbol->string and string->symbol convert between them.|#

;; Examples:

map
;; #<procedure:map>

(quote map)
;; 'map

(symbol? (quote map))
;; #t

(symbol? map)
;; #f

(procedure? map)
;; #t

(string->symbol "map")
;; 'map

(symbol->string (quote map))
;; "map"

#| In the same way that quote for a list automatically 
applies itself to nested lists, quote on a parenthesized 
sequence of identifiers automatically applies itself 
to the identifiers to create a list of symbols: |#

(car (quote (road map)))
;; 'road

(symbol? (car (quote (road map))))
;; #t

#| When a symbol is inside a list that is printed with ', 
the ' on the symbol is omitted, since ' is doing the 
job already: |#

(quote (road map))
;; '(road map)

#| The quote form has no effect on a literal expression 
such as a number or string: |#

(quote 42)
;; 42

(quote "on the record")
;; "on the record"
