;; 2.4 Pairs, Lists, and Racket Syntax

#| The cons function actually accepts any two values,
not just a list for the second argument. When the
second argument is not empty and not itself produced
by cons, the result prints in a special way. The two
values joined with cons are printed between parentheses,
but with a dot (i.e., a period surrounded by whitespace)
in between: |#

(cons 1 2)
;; '(1 . 2)

(cons "banana" "split")
;; '("banana" . "split")

#| Thus, a value produced by cons is not always a list.
In general, the result of cons is a pair. The more
traditional name for the cons? function is pair?,
and we’ll use the traditional name from now on. |#

#| The name rest also makes less sense for non-list pairs;
the more traditional names for first and rest are car
and cdr, respectively. (Granted, the traditional names
are also nonsense. Just remember that “a” comes before
“d,” and cdr is pronounced “could-er.”) |#

;; Examples:

(car (cons 1 2))
;; 1

(cdr (cons 1 2))
;; 2

(pair? empty)
;; #f

(pair? (cons 1 2))
;; #t

(pair? (list 1 2 3))
;; #t

#| Racket’s pair datatype and its relation to lists is
essentially a historical curiosity, along with the dot
notation for printing and the funny names car and cdr.
Pairs are deeply wired into the culture, specification, 
and implementation of Racket, however, so they survive 
in the language. |#

#| You are perhaps most likely to encounter a non-list pair
when making a mistake, such as accidentally reversing the 
arguments to cons: |#

(cons (list 2 3) 1)
;; '((2 3) . 1)

(cons 1 (list 2 3))
;; '(1 2 3)

#| Non-list pairs are used intentionally, sometimes. For 
example, the make-hash function takes a list of pairs, where 
the car of each pair is a key and the cdr is an arbitrary 
value. |#

#| The only thing more confusing to new Racketeers than 
non-list pairs is the printing convention for pairs where 
the second element is a pair, but is not a list: |#

(cons 0 (cons 1 2))
;; '(0 1 . 2)

#| In general, the rule for printing a pair is as follows:
use the dot notation unless the dot is immediately followed 
by an open parenthesis. In that case, remove the dot, the 
open parenthesis, and the matching close parenthesis. Thus, 
'(0 . (1 . 2)) becomes '(0 1 . 2), and '(1 . (2 . (3 . ()))) 
becomes '(1 2 3). |#
