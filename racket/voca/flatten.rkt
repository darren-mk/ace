;; (flatten v) â†’ list?
;; v : any/c
#| Flattens an arbitrary S-expression structure of pairs 
into a list. More precisely, v is treated as a binary tree 
where pairs are interior nodes, and the resulting list contains 
all of the non-null leaves of the tree in the same order as 
an inorder traversal. |#
