;; https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core.async/go
;; Asynchronously executes the body, returning immediately to the
;; calling thread. Additionally, any visible calls to <!, >! and alt!/alts!
;; channel operations within the body will block (if necessary) by
;; 'parking' the calling thread rather than tying up an OS thread
;; (or the only JS thread when in ClojureScript). Upon completion of the
;; operation, the body will be resumed.
;; Returns a channel which will receive the result of the body when
;; completed
