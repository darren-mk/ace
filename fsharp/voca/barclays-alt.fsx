(*
So we thought of having a really easy homework,
but has to be submitted in F#
(single file or paragraph, the submission should just a few lines).
Here is the assignment.
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.
Please submit the code snippet AND the result; result has the form of a single number.
