;; https://clojure.org/reference/vars
;; Clojure is a practical language that recognizes the occasional need
;; to maintain a persistent reference to a changing value and
;; provides 4 distinct mechanisms for doing so in a controlled manner
;; - Vars, Refs, Agents and Atoms.
;; Vars provide a mechanism to refer to a mutable storage location
;; that can be dynamically rebound (to a new storage location) on a per-thread basis.
;; Every Var can (but neednâ€™t) have a root binding,
;; which is a binding that is shared by all threads that do not have a per-thread binding.
;; Thus, the value of a Var is the value of its per-thread binding, or,
;; if it is not bound in the thread requesting the value, the value of the root binding, if any.
